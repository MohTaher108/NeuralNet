# NeuralNet

My neural network created from scratch with only numpy

To create environment:
```bash
conda env create
conda activate neural_net
```

To run code:
```bash
python train.py
```

Model achieves ~98% accuracy on palmerpenguins with one hidden layer of 6 neurons, 200 epochs, 0.2 learning_rate, 16 batch size, and 0.23 seconds
